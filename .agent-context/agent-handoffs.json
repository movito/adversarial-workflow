All high-priority work complete. Total time: ~4h (investigation 90min, implementation 60min, immediate actions 60min, coordination 60min). Follow-up enhancement tasks created for long-term improvements (tier upgrade analysis, file-splitting utilities). See delegation/handoffs/TASK-2025-0037-STATUS-REPORT.md and TASK-2025-0037-FILE-READING-INVESTIGATION-RESULTS.md. TASK-2025-0037 (2025-10-30): Assessment complete. Critical output validation implemented in v0.3.2 via TASK-2025-027 (validate_evaluation_output function, verdict parsing). Repo-map workaround implemented (--no-git, --map-tokens 0). Remaining phases (investigation, token verification, content verification) are enhancements with diminishing returns. Recommendation: Mark task as PARTIALLY COMPLETE, defer enhancements to backlog.

    "technical_notes": "TASK-TERMINOLOGY-001 COMPLETE (2025-10-19, 2.5h). Successfully reverted 'Reviewer' → 'Evaluator' terminology to eliminate ambiguity with 'document-reviewer' agent role. Updated 13 files: README.md, QUICK_START.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/TERMINOLOGY.md (v2.0), docs/EXAMPLES.md, docs/WORKFLOW_PHASES.md, docs/INTERACTION_PATTERNS.md, docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md, adversarial_workflow/__init__.py, adversarial_workflow/cli.py (line 322), 3 template files. Added critical distinction section explaining Evaluator (aider QA) vs document-reviewer (agent role). Created comprehensive decision document. No breaking changes - fully backward compatible. Ironic achievement: document-reviewer agent successfully fixed the confusion about its own name!",

    "technical_notes": "TASK-2025-0037 COMPLETE (2025-10-30, ~3h total): Comprehensive output validation and file reading enhancement. Investigation proved OpenAI rate limits (30k TPM) are constraint, not Aider. Implemented: file reading investigation (4 test files, systematic testing), token verification (estimate/extract/verify functions), immediate actions (README documentation, rate limit error detection, pre-flight warnings). All high-priority phases complete (1, 2A, 2B, 3). Phase 4 (content verification) skipped as optional. Total 5 commits (3ab165f, 334d1d8, b72c943, 450a600, e90651c). User impact: Clear file size guidance (~500 lines max for Tier 1), proactive warnings, helpful error messages with solutions. TASK-2025-027 + Verdict Parsing COMPLETE (2025-10-24, ~60min total): Fixed two evaluator issues: (1) False-positive bug when evaluation doesn't run (added --no-git flag, output validation), (2) Incorrect success message when verdict is NEEDS_REVISION/REJECTED (added verdict parsing and specific status reporting). Both fixes pushed to GitHub (commits 10847b0, 8ba587e). No version bump yet - awaiting integration testing in consuming project (thematic-cuts). All acceptance criteria met. Ready for production deployment.",
