All 5 tasks approved: TASK-SETUP-003 (fix check, 2.5h - COMPLETED by feature-dev), TASK-SETUP-002 (preflight script, 5h - IN PROGRESS), TASK-SETUP-001 (agent onboard, 8h - revised and approved), TASK-SETUP-005 (package guide, 3-5h), TASK-SETUP-004 (health check, 8h). Total effort: ~26.5-28.5 hours. Strategic planning complete: package separation (v0.4.0+), smoother aider install (combination approach), documentation standards (verbified command format).",
