## What's New in v0.6.2

### Bug Fixes You'll Notice

1. **Custom evaluators now reliably load .env variables**
   - Previously: `load_dotenv()` could fail to find `.env` in some contexts
   - Now: Explicit path loading ensures API keys are always available

2. **No more noisy "naming conflict" warnings**
   - Previously: Warning appeared for built-in `review` evaluator on every command
   - Now: Only warns for actual user-defined conflicts

3. **`adversarial check` shows accurate .env count**
   - Previously: Could show incorrect variable count
   - Now: Accurate display of loaded environment variables

### New Features

1. **scripts/project CLI** (if you sync from agentive-starter-kit)
   - Task lifecycle management: `./scripts/project start ASK-0001`
   - Proper boundary matching: `ADV-1` no longer matches `ADV-10`

## Verification Checklist

After upgrading, verify everything works:

```bash
# 1. Check version
adversarial --version
# Expected: adversarial-workflow 0.6.2

# 2. Verify configuration
adversarial check
# Should show green checkmarks for installed components

# 3. List evaluators
adversarial list
# Should show your custom evaluators (if any)

# 4. Test an evaluation (optional)
adversarial evaluate path/to/your/file.md
# Should run without errors
```
