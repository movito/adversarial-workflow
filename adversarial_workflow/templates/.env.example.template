# Adversarial Workflow - API Keys Configuration
# ================================================
#
# This file configures which AI models power your adversarial workflow.
# The workflow uses TWO models for quality assurance:
#
#   1. IMPLEMENTATION Agent: Writes code based on your task
#   2. EVALUATOR Agent: Reviews code for quality and correctness
#
# Why two models? Different perspectives catch more issues!
#
# ================================================
# RECOMMENDED SETUP (Best Quality)
# ================================================
#
# Implementation: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic)
# Evaluator: GPT-4o (OpenAI)
# Cost: ~$0.02-0.10 per workflow
#
# You'll need BOTH API keys:

# Anthropic API Key (for Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
# Get yours at: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
# Starts with: sk-ant-
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key-here

# OpenAI API Key (for GPT-4o)
# Get yours at: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# Starts with: sk-proj- or sk-
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# ================================================
# ALTERNATIVE SETUP (Simpler)
# ================================================
#
# Option A: OpenAI only (both agents use GPT-4o)
# - Just set OPENAI_API_KEY above
# - Comment out or leave ANTHROPIC_API_KEY empty
# - Cost: ~$0.05-0.15 per workflow
#
# Option B: Anthropic only (both agents use Claude)
# - Just set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY above
# - Comment out or leave OPENAI_API_KEY empty
# - Cost: ~$0.02-0.10 per workflow
#
# ================================================
# SECURITY NOTE
# ================================================
#
# This file (.env) is automatically added to .gitignore.
# Your API keys will NOT be committed to git.
# Never share this file or commit it to version control.
