AGENT BRIEFING: Integrate adversarial-workflow v0.3.0 into thematic-cuts

CONTEXT:
The adversarial-workflow package has reached v0.3.0 with a new agent coordination system. It's ready to integrate back into thematic-cuts for Phase 2 development and dogfooding.

YOUR MISSION:
1. Install adversarial-workflow v0.3.0 in thematic-cuts
2. Verify health and configuration
3. Continue Phase 2A tasks using the workflow
4. Provide feedback for package improvements

QUICK START:
```bash
cd /Users/broadcaster_three/Github/thematic-cuts
pip install /Users/broadcaster_three/Github/adversarial-workflow/dist/adversarial_workflow-0.3.0-py3-none-any.whl
adversarial --version  # Should show: 0.3.0
adversarial health --verbose
```

KEY CHANGES IN v0.3.0:
- New: 'adversarial health' command (system diagnostics)
- New: 'adversarial agent onboard' command (agent coordination setup)
- Improved: API key detection (loads .env automatically)
- Improved: Error messages (ERROR/WHY/FIX/HELP pattern)
- Packaged: AGENT-SYSTEM-GUIDE.md included in distribution

CURRENT STATE:
- thematic-cuts: v1.0.2, Phase 2A 25% complete
- Location: /Users/broadcaster_three/Github/thematic-cuts
- Already has: .agent-context/, delegation/, agents/ (agent coordination)
- Has old: adversarial-workflow/ directory (needs cleanup)
- Active tasks: 10+ in delegation/tasks/active/

INTEGRATION STEPS:

1. INSTALL v0.3.0
   cd /Users/broadcaster_three/Github/thematic-cuts
   pip install /Users/broadcaster_three/Github/adversarial-workflow/dist/adversarial_workflow-0.3.0-py3-none-any.whl

2. VERIFY HEALTH
   adversarial health
   Expected: >70% health score, all critical checks passing

3. CHECK CONFIGURATION
   cat .adversarial/config.yml
   Ensure task_directory points to: delegation/tasks/

4. TEST WITH A TASK
   adversarial evaluate delegation/tasks/active/TASK-2025-006-semantic-parser-compound-instructions.md

5. CLEAN UP OLD DIRECTORY
   rm -rf adversarial-workflow/  # (the nested directory, NOT the package!)

WORKFLOW FOR PHASE 2 TASKS:
- Phase 1: adversarial evaluate delegation/tasks/active/TASK-XXX.md
- Phase 2: Implement (Claude Code, Cursor, manual)
- Phase 3: adversarial review
- Phase 4: adversarial validate pytest
- Phase 5: Commit and move to completed/

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
✓ adversarial --version shows 0.3.0
✓ adversarial health shows >70%
✓ Can evaluate, review, validate tasks
✓ Agent coordination intact (.agent-context/ valid)
✓ Complete at least 1 Phase 2 task using workflow

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- "command not found" → Package not installed, run pip install again
- "Not initialized" → Run: adversarial init --interactive
- "No API keys" → Check .env file exists and has valid keys
- Health "degraded" → Run: adversarial health --verbose for details

FULL DOCUMENTATION:
See: /Users/broadcaster_three/Github/adversarial-workflow/HANDOFF-TO-THEMATIC-CUTS.md

QUESTIONS?
- Check: adversarial health --verbose
- Read: .agent-context/AGENT-SYSTEM-GUIDE.md
- Docs: README.md, QUICK_START.md, docs/EXAMPLES.md

FEEDBACK WANTED:
As you use v0.3.0, note:
- UX friction points
- Confusing error messages
- Missing features
- Performance issues
- Documentation gaps
