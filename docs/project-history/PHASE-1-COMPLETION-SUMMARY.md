### Phase 1.3: Terminology Fixes (v0.2.4) âœ…

**Status**: COMPLETE (Work already done in v0.2.0)
**Time**: 30 minutes (verification only)
**Time Saved**: ~4-5 hours (duplicate work avoided)
**Outcome**: No v0.2.4 release needed

**Discovery**:
- Planned to implement terminology changes (Coordinator/Evaluator â†’ Author/Reviewer)
- Investigation revealed work was already done in v0.2.0
- CHANGELOG evidence: "73 fixes across 11 files"
- Verification confirmed clean codebase

**Actions Taken**:
- Read CHANGELOG.md to check release history
- Verified key files (README.md, scripts, templates)
- Searched codebase for remaining deprecated terms
- Confirmed only test venvs and historical docs contain old terms
- Created verification document

**Documentation Created**:
- `adversarial-workflow/tasks/completed/PHASE-1-3-TERMINOLOGY-VERIFICATION.md`

**Lesson Learned**:
Always check CHANGELOG first before starting work. Good documentation prevents duplicate effort.

---

### Phase 1.4: Onboarding Enhancements (v0.2.5) âœ…

**Status**: COMPLETE (Work already done in v0.2.0)
**Time**: 1 hour (review only)
**Time Saved**: ~8-12 hours (duplicate work avoided)
**Outcome**: No new v0.2.5 work needed

**Discovery**:
- Planned to implement interactive onboarding features
- Review of cli.py revealed extensive implementation (lines 195-517)
- CHANGELOG.md confirmed released in v0.2.0
- All HIGH priority features already complete

**Features Already Implemented** (v0.2.0):

**Phase 1: Enhanced `init --interactive`** âœ…
- Interactive setup wizard with API key input
- Educational messaging about two-AI system
- API key format validation
- .env file creation with user consent
- Platform compatibility checks (Windows warning)
- Three setup options (Both APIs / OpenAI only / Anthropic only)

**Phase 2: `quickstart` command** âœ…
- Example task creation
- Guided first workflow
- Auto-detection of uninitialized state
- Interactive tutorial-style output
- Clear next steps

**Phase 3: Enhanced `check` command** âœ… (Partially)
- Comprehensive validation (git, aider, API keys, config, scripts)
- Clear error messages with fix suggestions
- `doctor` command alias
- Missing: API credit balance checking, `--fix` flag

**Phase 4 & 5: Deferred to v0.3.0**
- Examples system (multiple templates)
- Configuration wizard
- These are MEDIUM/LOW priority, better for standalone repo

**Documentation Created**:
- `adversarial-workflow/tasks/completed/PHASE-1-4-ONBOARDING-STATUS.md`

**Recommendation**:
No v0.2.5 release needed. Current v0.2.3 has all core onboarding features from v0.2.0.

### Phase 1.5: Handoff Documentation ðŸ”„

**Status**: IN PROGRESS
**Next Step**: Create handoff document for standalone repo transition

## Key Learnings

### What Worked Well

1. **Discovery Before Implementation**
   - Checking CHANGELOG first prevented ~15 hours of duplicate work
   - Verification approach was thorough and systematic
   - Created clear documentation of findings

2. **Task Organization**
   - Clean separation of thematic-cuts vs. adversarial-workflow tasks
   - Logical directory structure for active vs. completed vs. analysis
   - Easy to trace what was done when

3. **Git Workflow**
   - Small, focused commits (5311cfe, c4ed347)
   - Clear commit messages
   - Easy to push and synchronize

### Process Improvements

1. **Always Check CHANGELOG First**
   - Before planning new work, review what's been released
   - Prevents duplicate effort
   - Reveals actual state vs. assumed state

2. **Verify Before Building**
   - Grep/Read to confirm current state
   - Don't assume task specs are accurate
   - Task specs may be aspirational, not actual requirements

3. **Document Discoveries**
   - Create verification documents for future reference
   - Explain why work was skipped
   - Preserve lessons learned
