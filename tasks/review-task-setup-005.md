# Task: Review TASK-SETUP-005 Implementation

**Type**: Code Review
**Priority**: High
**Context**: TASK-SETUP-005 Package AGENT-SYSTEM-GUIDE.md

## Objective

Review the implementation of TASK-SETUP-005 which packages AGENT-SYSTEM-GUIDE.md with adversarial-workflow and automatically copies it to `.agent-context/` during initialization.

## Implementation Summary

**What was implemented:**
1. Copied AGENT-SYSTEM-GUIDE.md (34KB) to `adversarial_workflow/templates/agent-context/`
2. Updated `pyproject.toml` to include `templates/agent-context/*` in package data
3. Added guide copying logic to `cli.py` `init()` function (lines 709-717)
4. Updated `QUICK_START.md` with agent coordination section
5. Tested successfully in temp directory

**Files modified:**
- `adversarial_workflow/templates/agent-context/AGENT-SYSTEM-GUIDE.md` (new, 34KB)
- `pyproject.toml` (line 56: added `templates/agent-context/*`)
- `adversarial_workflow/cli.py` (lines 709-717: guide copying logic)
- `QUICK_START.md` (lines 146-175: agent coordination documentation)
- `delegation/tasks/active/TASK-SETUP-005-PACKAGE-AGENT-GUIDE.md` (completion summary)
- `.agent-context/agent-handoffs.json` (feature-developer status)

## Review Focus Areas

### 1. Code Quality
- Is the implementation in `cli.py` correct and robust?
- Does it handle edge cases (directory doesn't exist, file already exists)?
- Is error handling appropriate?
- Are there any potential issues with Path vs string handling?

### 2. Package Configuration
- Is `pyproject.toml` configured correctly for including template files?
- Will the guide be properly included in the distributed package?
- Are there any missing dependencies or imports?

### 3. Testing & Verification
- Was the testing approach adequate?
- Are there scenarios that weren't tested?
- Should unit tests be added?

### 4. Documentation
- Is the documentation update in `QUICK_START.md` clear and helpful?
- Are there other documentation files that should mention this feature?
- Is the completion summary in the task file thorough?

### 5. Design Decisions
- Was it correct to skip optional features (fallback download, version check)?
- Should the guide copying be more visible to users?
- Are there any missing requirements from the original task spec?

### 6. Acceptance Criteria
- Were all "Must Have" criteria met or properly addressed?
- Are the N/A markings justified?
- Should any "Should Have" features be reconsidered?

## Acceptance Criteria for This Review

- [ ] Code implementation is correct and handles edge cases
- [ ] Package configuration will properly distribute the guide
- [ ] Testing approach was adequate for this change
- [ ] Documentation updates are clear and complete
- [ ] Design decisions are justified and appropriate
- [ ] All original task requirements are addressed

## Questions for Reviewer

1. Is the implementation in `cli.py` lines 709-717 robust enough?
2. Should we add any error handling for the file copying?
3. Is the `pyproject.toml` configuration sufficient for package distribution?
4. Should unit tests be added, or is manual testing adequate for this feature?
5. Are there any security concerns with copying the guide file?
6. Should the guide copying be logged/printed to the user during init?
7. Are there any edge cases we haven't considered?

## Expected Outcome

Reviewer should provide:
- Assessment of code quality and correctness
- Identification of any bugs or issues
- Suggestions for improvements (if any)
- Confirmation that the implementation meets requirements
- APPROVED or NEEDS_REVISION verdict
