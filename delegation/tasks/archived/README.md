## Archived Tasks

### TASK-AGENT-COORDINATE-PHASE-MINUS-1-VALIDATION.md
**Archived**: 2025-10-19
**Reason**: Superseded by agent-roles-template repository approach
**Context**: User validation phase was planned for agent-coordinate package extraction, but template repository approach was chosen instead (5h vs 80-90h effort). See delegation/tasks/active/TASK-AGENT-COORDINATE-DECISION-DOCUMENT.md for full decision rationale.

### TASK-AGENT-COORDINATE-PHASE-0-MINIMAL-EXTRACTION.md
**Archived**: 2025-10-19
**Reason**: Superseded by agent-roles-template repository approach
**Context**: Package extraction was planned but deemed unnecessary. Template repository (github.com/movito/agent-roles-template) provides same user value with minimal effort. See delegation/tasks/active/TASK-AGENT-COORDINATE-DECISION-DOCUMENT.md for full decision rationale.
