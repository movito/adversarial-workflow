# TASK-AGENT-COORDINATE-PHASE-MINUS-1-VALIDATION

**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: NOT_STARTED
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Assigned**: Coordinator
**Estimated Effort**: 3-5 hours
**Blocks**: All agent-coordinate extraction work

---

## Overview

**Phase -1: Discovery & Validation** for agent-coordinate package extraction.

**CRITICAL**: This phase MUST be completed successfully before any extraction work begins. If validation fails, extraction is cancelled.

---

## Context

The agent-coordinate package plan (v2.0) requires demand validation before proceeding with 80+ hours of extraction work. Currently, we have:
- ✅ 1 dogfooding project (thematic-cuts) validates concept
- ❌ 0 user interviews conducted
- ❌ Unknown market size (estimated 50-200 potential users, but unproven)
- ❌ No evidence anyone wants this as standalone package

**Risk**: Spending 80+ hours building for audience of <10 users

---

## Objectives

1. **Validate market demand**: Find 5+ people who would use agent-coordinate as standalone package
2. **Confirm pain points**: Verify multi-agent coordination is real problem (not just theoretical)
3. **Assess willingness to adopt**: Would users install separate package or prefer embedded in adversarial-workflow?
4. **Gather requirements**: What features do users actually need vs. what we think they need?

---

## Success Criteria

**MUST ACHIEVE ALL**:
- ✅ Complete 5+ user interviews (adversarial-workflow users + Claude Code community)
- ✅ Find 5+ people who say "I would use this as standalone package"
- ✅ Validate pain points are real (users describe coordination challenges)
- ✅ Confirm willingness to install separate package (not just "nice idea")

**DECISION GATE**:
- **If PASS (5+ interested users)**: Proceed to Phase 0 (Minimal Extraction)
- **If FAIL (<5 interested users)**: STOP - Keep agent coordination in adversarial-workflow, improve docs instead

## Tasks

### 1. Prepare Research Materials (30 minutes)

- [ ] Create interview script
  - Questions about multi-agent workflows
  - Questions about coordination challenges
  - Questions about tool preferences
  - Questions about willingness to install separate package
- [ ] Draft community post (Claude Code forums/Discord)
- [ ] Identify adversarial-workflow users to interview

### 2. Conduct User Interviews (2-3 hours)

**Target**: 5-10 interviews, 15-20 minutes each

**Interview Sources**:
- [ ] adversarial-workflow users (if any exist beyond you)
  - Do they use `adversarial agent onboard`?
  - What coordination challenges do they face?
  - Would they use standalone package?
- [ ] Claude Code community (forums, Discord, Reddit r/ClaudeAI)
  - Post: "How do you manage multi-agent workflows?"
  - Gauge interest in structured coordination
- [ ] Twitter/X (AI dev community)
  - Share pain point, ask for feedback
- [ ] Your own network (developers using Claude Code)

**Key Questions**:
1. Do you use multi-agent workflows with Claude Code?
2. How do you currently manage context across agent sessions?
3. What coordination challenges do you face?
4. Would you install a separate package for agent coordination?
5. What features would be most valuable to you?
6. Would you pay for this? (even $5 validates value)

### 3. Analyze Competitive Landscape (1 hour)

- [ ] Search GitHub for "multi-agent coordination"
- [ ] Search PyPI for "agent coordination", "multi-agent", "claude"
- [ ] Review AutoGPT, CrewAI, LangChain multi-agent approaches
- [ ] Document existing solutions and their limitations
- [ ] Identify differentiation opportunities

### 4. Synthesize Findings (1 hour)

- [ ] Create user research document
  - Interview summaries
  - Pain point patterns
  - Interest level (strong/weak/none)
  - Feature requests
- [ ] Count interested users (5+ needed to proceed)
- [ ] Identify key insights
- [ ] Make GO/NO-GO recommendation

### 5. Decision Gate (30 minutes)

**Assess Results**:
- Did we find 5+ interested users?
- Are pain points real and urgent?
- Would users actually install this?
- Do benefits justify 80+ hours effort?

**Make Decision**:
- **GO**: Proceed to Phase 0 (Minimal Extraction)
- **NO-GO**: Keep in adversarial-workflow, improve documentation

---

## Deliverables

1. **User Research Document** (`docs/USER-RESEARCH-AGENT-COORDINATE.md`)
   - Interview summaries (5+ interviews)
   - Pain point validation
   - Interest level quantification
   - Feature requests
   - Competitive analysis

2. **GO/NO-GO Decision Document** (`docs/AGENT-COORDINATE-DECISION.md`)
   - Summary of findings
   - Count of interested users
   - Recommendation (GO or NO-GO)
   - Rationale for decision

---

## Exit Criteria

**If Validation SUCCEEDS (5+ interested users)**:
- ✅ Document findings
- ✅ Create Phase 0 task (minimal extraction)
- ✅ Set realistic expectations (80+ hours total)
- ✅ Plan beta testing with interested users

**If Validation FAILS (<5 interested users)**:
- ✅ Document findings (valuable learning)
- ✅ Keep agent coordination in adversarial-workflow v0.4.0
- ✅ Improve documentation instead (5-10 hours)
- ✅ Create "Better Agent Coordination Docs" task
- ✅ Revisit extraction in 6-12 months if adoption grows

---

## Timeline

**Week 1**:
- Day 1-2: Prepare materials, post in communities
- Day 3-5: Conduct interviews
- Day 6: Analyze findings
- Day 7: Make decision

**Total Time**: 3-5 hours spread over 1 week

---

## Notes

**Important Reminders**:
- Be open to NO-GO outcome (it saves 80+ hours)
- Better documentation may solve same problem at 1/10th effort
- Organic demand > forced extraction
- 1 project validation (thematic-cuts) is not enough
- Market size matters (50 users ≠ 5 users)

**Questions to Answer Honestly**:
- Are we solving for users or for architecture satisfaction?
- Is this highest-value use of 80+ hours?
- Could we achieve same value with better docs?

## Status Updates

**2025-10-17**: Task created. Not started. Awaiting decision to proceed with Phase -1.

**CRITICAL PATH**: This task is the gate for entire agent-coordinate project. Success = proceed. Failure = cancel extraction.
