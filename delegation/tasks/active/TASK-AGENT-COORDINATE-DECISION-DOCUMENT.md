# TASK-AGENT-COORDINATE-DECISION-DOCUMENT

**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: NOT_STARTED
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Assigned**: Coordinator
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours
**Dependencies**: Complete after Phase -1 or at any decision gate

---

## Overview

Create decision document for agent-coordinate package extraction based on validation and execution results.

**Purpose**: Record GO/NO-GO decision with rationale for future reference

---

## Context

The agent-coordinate package plan requires multiple decision gates:
1. **After Phase -1**: Did validation succeed? (5+ interested users?)
2. **After Phase 0**: Did minimal extraction work? (beta testing successful?)
3. **After Phase 1**: Should we release? (quality acceptable?)

This task creates the decision document that records which path we chose and why.

---

## Objectives

1. Document validation results (Phase -1)
2. Record decision (GO/NO-GO)
3. Provide rationale for decision
4. Set expectations for next steps
5. Define success metrics

---

## Success Criteria

- âœ… Decision clearly stated (GO or NO-GO)
- âœ… Rationale documented (evidence-based)
- âœ… User research summarized
- âœ… Next steps defined
- âœ… Success metrics established

## Decision Rationale

### Why GO

[If GO decision]
- Evidence of demand: X interested users
- Technical feasibility: Extraction successful
- Value proposition: Clear benefits
- Resource availability: Y hours available
- Motivation: Strong/sustained

### Why NO-GO

[If NO-GO decision]
- Insufficient demand: <5 interested users
- Technical challenges: Extraction failed
- Unclear value: Benefits not compelling
- Resource constraints: Insufficient time
- Alternative approaches: Better solutions exist

### Why DEFER

[If DEFER decision]
- Need more data: Insufficient validation
- Wait for adoption: Let adversarial-workflow grow
- Timing: Other priorities higher
- Revisit: In 6-12 months

---

## Path Forward

### If GO

**Next Phase**: [Phase 0 / Phase 1 / Phase 2]
**Timeline**: X weeks, Y hours
**Assigned**: [Agent]
**Success Criteria**:
- [Criterion 1]
- [Criterion 2]
...

### If NO-GO

**Alternative**: Keep in adversarial-workflow v0.4.0
**Improvement Plan**:
1. Improve documentation (5-10 hours)
2. Add examples to AGENT-SYSTEM-GUIDE.md
3. Create video tutorial
4. Build adoption to 50+ users
5. Revisit extraction in 6-12 months

### If DEFER

**Revisit Date**: 2025-XX-XX
**Conditions for Revisit**:
- adversarial-workflow has 50+ users
- Multiple users request extraction
- Evidence of broader market emerges

---

## Success Metrics (If GO)

### v0.1.0 Goals (3 months)

| Metric | Target | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| PyPI downloads/week | 10-20 | Realistic for niche tool |
| Production users | 3-5 | Beyond beta testers |
| GitHub stars | 25-50 | If promoted |
| Community contributions | 1-2 | If lucky |

**Qualitative Success**: 3 users say "This solved my problem"

### Red Flags (Exit Criteria)

If 2+ of these after 3 months:
- ðŸš© <5 weekly downloads
- ðŸš© Zero GitHub issues/questions
- ðŸš© No community engagement
- ðŸš© Only you using it

â†’ Archive repo, fold back into adversarial-workflow

- **After Phase 1**: 1 hour to finalize with lessons learned

**Total**: 1-2 hours spread across phases

---

## Dependencies

**Depends On**:

## Notes

**Purpose of This Document**:
- Record decision for future reference
- Provide transparency on rationale
- Set expectations for stakeholders
- Document lessons learned
- Enable future revisiting (if DEFER or NO-GO)

**Key Principle**: Be honest and evidence-based. Don't rationalize a decision you want. Follow the data.

## Status Updates

**2025-10-17**: Task created. Will execute after Phase -1 completes.

**IMPORTANT**: This document is the official record of whether we proceed with extraction or keep agent coordination in adversarial-workflow.
