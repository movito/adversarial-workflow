# ENHANCEMENT-001: OpenAI Tier Upgrade Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Priority**: LOW
**Type**: Enhancement / Investigation
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Parent Task**: TASK-2025-0037 (follow-up)

---

## Context

TASK-2025-0037 investigation revealed that OpenAI rate limits (30,000 TPM for Tier 1 accounts) constrain evaluation file sizes to ~500-600 lines. Upgrading to higher tiers would allow larger files.

## Objective

Analyze the cost-benefit of upgrading the OpenAI organization tier to support larger evaluation files.

## Scope

### Analysis Tasks

1. **Current State Assessment**
   - Document current tier (Tier 1: 30k TPM)
   - Document current usage patterns
   - Analyze existing evaluation file sizes
   - Identify how many evaluations fail due to rate limits

2. **Tier Comparison**
   | Tier | TPM Limit | Max File Size | Monthly Cost | Upgrade Cost |
   |------|-----------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
   | Tier 1 (current) | 30,000 | ~600 lines | $0 base | N/A |
   | Tier 2 | 50,000 | ~1,000 lines | $50-150/mo | +$50-150 |
   | Tier 3 | 100,000 | ~2,000 lines | $150-500/mo | +$150-500 |
   | Tier 4 | 500,000 | ~10,000 lines | $500+/mo | +$500+ |

3. **Use Case Analysis**
   - How often do users need to evaluate files >600 lines?
   - What percentage of evaluations would benefit?
   - Alternative: Encourage file splitting vs tier upgrade

4. **Cost-Benefit Calculation**
   - Monthly cost increase
   - Value delivered (larger files supported)
   - ROI analysis
   - Break-even point

5. **Recommendation**
   - Should we upgrade? If so, to which tier?
   - Alternative strategies if upgrade not justified
   - Documentation updates needed

## Deliverables

1. **Analysis Report**: `delegation/handoffs/OPENAI-TIER-UPGRADE-ANALYSIS.md`
   - Current state assessment
   - Tier comparison table
   - Use case analysis
   - Cost-benefit calculation
   - Recommendation with rationale

2. **Documentation Updates** (if upgrade recommended):
   - Update README.md with new file size limits
   - Update evaluation error messages
   - Update TROUBLESHOOTING.md

3. **Decision Record** (if upgrade occurs):
   - Document decision to upgrade
   - Rationale and cost justification
   - Implementation plan

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Comprehensive tier comparison completed
- ✅ Current usage patterns documented
- ✅ Cost-benefit analysis with clear recommendation
- ✅ Decision record created (if upgrade recommended)
- ✅ Documentation updated (if limits change)

## Notes

- This is a **business decision**, not just technical
- Consider: project budget, user needs, alternative solutions
- File splitting may be more cost-effective than tier upgrade
- Recommendation should balance cost vs user experience
