**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: ‚úÖ VERIFIED COMPLETE (Work already done in v0.2.0)
**Outcome**: No v0.2.4 release needed - terminology already standardized

---

## Summary

Phase 1.3 was planned to implement terminology changes from "Coordinator/Evaluator" to "Author/Reviewer". However, investigation revealed these changes were **already completed in v0.2.0** release.

---

## Investigation Findings

### CHANGELOG Evidence

From `CHANGELOG.md` lines 97-100 (v0.2.0 release):

```markdown
**Terminology Standardization**: Updated from "Coordinator/Evaluator" to
"Author/Reviewer" pattern (73 fixes across 11 files)
  - More intuitive and aligns with industry-standard code review terminology
  - Eliminates confusion about roles and responsibilities
  - Backward compatible - no breaking changes to configuration files
```

**Conclusion**: 73 fixes across 11 files were already completed and released in v0.2.0.

## Verification Results

### Current State of Key Files

**1. README.md**
- ‚úÖ Lines 92-116: Uses "Reviewer" and "Author" terminology
- ‚úÖ Lines 140-156: Explains roles as metaphors, not technical components
- ‚úÖ Line 157: Historical note about Coordinator/Evaluator deprecation

**2. evaluate_plan.sh**
- ‚úÖ Line 104: "REVIEWER ($EVALUATOR_MODEL)"
- ‚úÖ Line 112-115: "You are a REVIEWER performing critical design review"
- ‚úÖ Uses generic "the implementation plan" (not "Coordinator's plan")

**3. review_implementation.sh**
- ‚úÖ Line 137: "REVIEWER ($EVALUATOR_MODEL)"
- ‚úÖ Line 151: "You are a REVIEWER performing critical code review"
- ‚úÖ Uses "Author's work" generically

**4. validate_tests.sh**
- ‚úÖ Uses "Reviewer" terminology consistently

**5. Documentation Files**
- ‚úÖ `docs/TERMINOLOGY.md`: Explains Author/Reviewer pattern
- ‚úÖ `docs/INTERACTION_PATTERNS.md`: Uses new terminology
- ‚úÖ `docs/WORKFLOW_PHASES.md`: Updated to Author/Reviewer
- ‚úÖ `docs/EXAMPLES.md`: Uses new terminology

### Remaining References

Grep found "Coordinator" or "Evaluator" in 50 files, but inspection shows:

**Test Venvs** (Installed old version):
- `test_venv_023/lib/python3.12/site-packages/` - v0.2.3 installed package
- These will update naturally when v0.3.0 is released

**Historical Documentation** (Intentional):
- `tasks/analysis/ADVERSARIAL-WORKFLOW-INDEPENDENCE-ANALYSIS.md` - Explains terminology evolution
- `docs/TERMINOLOGY.md` - Deprecation table showing old ‚Üí new mapping
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Historical records

**Technical Variables** (Backward compatibility):
- `evaluator_model` in `config.yml` - Intentionally unchanged
- `EVALUATOR_MODEL` in scripts - Intentionally unchanged
- These maintain backward compatibility as per v0.2.0 design decision

---

## Conclusion

### What Was Planned
- Phase 1.3: Implement terminology changes across 16 files
- Release v0.2.4 with terminology fixes

### What Actually Happened
- Terminology changes were completed in v0.2.0 (previous release)
- No additional work needed for v0.2.4
- Current codebase is clean and consistent

### Decision
**Skip v0.2.4 release** - no changes to make.

**Next Step**: Proceed directly to Phase 1.4 (v0.2.5 - Onboarding Enhancements)

## Version Strategy Update

**Original Plan**:
- v0.2.3 ‚úÖ (API key validation) - RELEASED
- v0.2.4 ‚ùå (Terminology fixes) - NOT NEEDED
- v0.2.5 üîÑ (Onboarding enhancements) - IN PROGRESS

**Revised Plan**:
- v0.2.3 ‚úÖ (API key validation) - RELEASED
- v0.2.4 ‚è≠Ô∏è (SKIP - work already complete)
- **v0.2.4 becomes v0.2.5** (Onboarding enhancements) - NEXT

## Time Saved

**Estimated time for Phase 1.3**: 4-6 hours
**Actual time spent**: 30 minutes (verification)
**Time saved**: ~4-5 hours

This time can now be allocated to Phase 1.4 (Onboarding enhancements).

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always check CHANGELOG first** - Can reveal work already completed
2. **Verify assumptions before starting** - Investigation prevented duplicate work
3. **Good documentation pays off** - CHANGELOG made verification straightforward
4. **Version history matters** - Understanding what was released helps planning

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Mark Phase 1.3 as complete (this document)
2. üîÑ Proceed to Phase 1.4: Onboarding Enhancements (v0.2.5)
3. üìã Update strategic plan to reflect skipped v0.2.4
