✅ **Evaluator system IS functional** - successfully performed 3 evaluation rounds with intelligent feedback
⚠️ **Wrapper script bug identified** - reports "✅ Evaluation approved!" even when verdict is NEEDS_REVISION
✅ **Full revision cycle tested** - demonstrated complete adversarial workflow
✅ **Quality validated** - evaluator provides progressively more detailed, context-aware feedback

---

## Test Methodology

**Approach**: Use TASK-2025-026 (AAF Export) as test case for multi-round evaluation cycle

**Test Sequence**:
1. Submit initial plan → Evaluate
2. Address feedback → Re-evaluate
3. Address second round feedback → Final evaluation
4. Document findings

---

## Evaluation Results

### Round 1: Initial Evaluation

**Input**: Basic AAF export plan (original version)

**Output**:
- **Verdict**: NEEDS_REVISION
- **Confidence**: MEDIUM
- **Cost**: $0.04
- **Tokens**: 14k sent, 445 received

**Feedback Quality**: ✅ Excellent
- Identified 3 critical gaps: error handling, dependency compatibility, CLI UX
- Provided specific, actionable recommendations
- Asked intelligent questions

**Evaluator Status**: ✅ **WORKING** - providing real GPT-4o evaluations

### Round 2: After Addressing Initial Feedback

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling strategy (media files, export failures)
- ✅ Added dependency compatibility verification steps (Phase 1 detailed)
- ✅ Expanded CLI integration with detailed usage examples

**Output**:
- **Verdict**: NEEDS_REVISION (still)
- **Confidence**: HIGH (upgraded from MEDIUM)
- **Cost**: $0.04
- **Tokens**: 16k sent, 481 received

**Feedback Quality**: ✅ **Excellent - Recognized Improvements**
- Acknowledged all 3 original concerns were addressed
- Raised NEW, more detailed concerns (file paths, integration tests, logging implementation)
- Higher confidence level shows it's actually reading content

**Key Insight**: Evaluator is progressive - as plan improves, it asks more detailed questions

### Round 3: After Addressing Second Round Feedback

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Added exact file paths and function signatures
- ✅ Added integration/end-to-end testing strategy
- ✅ Added detailed logging/error reporting implementation
- ✅ Added backward compatibility impact assessment

**Output**:
- **Verdict**: NEEDS_REVISION (still)
- **Confidence**: MEDIUM
- **Cost**: $0.05
- **Tokens**: 18k sent, 437 received

**Feedback Quality**: ✅ **Good - But Reaching Implementation Territory**
- Acknowledged previous improvements
- Now asking for implementation-level details (exact logic of to_otio_timeline method)
- Questions more appropriate for implementation phase, not planning

**Key Insight**: Evaluator may be TOO thorough - asking for code-level details better determined during implementation

---

## Verification Outcomes

### ✅ VERIFIED: Core Functionality

1. **Git issue resolved**: `git gc --prune=now` cleaned up BadObject error
2. **Aider working**: Successfully scans repo, calls GPT-4o, produces evaluations
3. **Output validation working**: Detects small log files (false positives fixed)
4. **Cost tracking**: $0.13 total for 3 evaluations (reasonable)
5. **Progressive feedback**: Each round shows evaluator read previous changes

### ✅ VERIFIED: Full Adversarial Workflow

```
Plan v1 → NEEDS_REVISION → Author revises → Plan v2 → NEEDS_REVISION →
Author revises → Plan v3 → NEEDS_REVISION (implementation-level details)
```

**What this proves**:
- Evaluator reads and understands content
- Recognizes when concerns are addressed
- Provides increasingly detailed feedback
- Full revision cycle functional

### ⚠️ IDENTIFIED: Wrapper Script Bug

**Issue**: Script reports "✅ Evaluation approved!" even when verdict is "NEEDS_REVISION"

**Evidence**:
```bash
# All 3 evaluations ended with:
Verdict: NEEDS_REVISION
...
[92m✅ Evaluation approved![0m  # <-- WRONG
```

**Expected Behavior**: Should check verdict and report:
- "✅ Evaluation APPROVED!" only when verdict = "APPROVED"
- "⚠️ Evaluation NEEDS_REVISION" when verdict = "NEEDS_REVISION"
- "❌ Evaluation REJECTED" when verdict = "REJECTED"

**Impact**: LOW - log file contains correct verdict, but terminal output is confusing

**Recommendation**: Update wrapper to parse verdict from evaluation output

## Cost Analysis

| Round | Tokens Sent | Tokens Received | Cost | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|------|------------|
| 1     | 14,000      | 445             | $0.04| $0.04      |
| 2     | 16,000      | 481             | $0.04| $0.08      |
| 3     | 18,000      | 437             | $0.05| $0.13      |

**Per-evaluation cost**: $0.04-0.05 (acceptable)
**Total verification cost**: $0.13 (3 rounds)

---

## Quality Assessment

### Evaluator Strengths

1. **Context awareness**: Recognized previously addressed concerns
2. **Progressive detail**: Asked more detailed questions each round
3. **Specific feedback**: Provided actionable recommendations, not vague critiques
4. **Intelligent questions**: Asked about implementation details, edge cases, testing

### Evaluator Limitations

1. **May be too thorough**: Asks for implementation-level details better determined during coding
2. **No clear approval threshold**: Unclear what level of detail satisfies evaluator
3. **Planning vs implementation blur**: Doesn't distinguish between planning completeness and implementation specifics

### Recommendation for Use

**Best practices**:
- ✅ Use evaluator for high-level plan validation
- ✅ Address CRITICAL and HIGH priority feedback
- ⚠️ Use judgment on MEDIUM/LOW feedback (may be implementation details)
- ⚠️ Don't iterate indefinitely - after 2-3 rounds, proceed to implementation
- ✅ Focus on evaluator's questions, not just verdict

---

## Task-Specific Outcomes

### TASK-2025-026 Plan Status

**Current state**: Comprehensive, implementation-ready plan

**Improvements made**:
- Error handling strategy (3 failure modes covered)
- Dependency compatibility verification (5-step process)
- CLI integration (7 usage examples, help output)
- File structure and function signatures (exact paths, types)
- Integration testing strategy (5 test cases + manual checklist)
- Logging implementation (4 log levels, rich progress bars)
- Backward compatibility assessment (zero breaking changes)

**Total additions**: ~350 lines of planning detail

**Manual coordinator assessment**: ✅ **APPROVED for implementation**
- Plan is comprehensive and well-thought-out
- All critical concerns addressed
- Remaining evaluator questions are implementation-level
- Risk: LOW, Confidence: HIGH

---

## Recommendations

### For Evaluator System

1. **Fix wrapper verdict detection**:
   ```python
   if "Verdict: APPROVED" in evaluation_output:
       print("✅ Evaluation APPROVED!")
   elif "Verdict: NEEDS_REVISION" in evaluation_output:
       print("⚠️ Evaluation NEEDS_REVISION")
   elif "Verdict: REJECTED" in evaluation_output:
       print("❌ Evaluation REJECTED")
   ```

2. **Add iteration limit guidance**: After 2-3 NEEDS_REVISION cycles, suggest proceeding to implementation

3. **Distinguish planning vs implementation**: Guidance on appropriate detail level for planning phase

### For TASK-2025-026

**Recommendation**: ✅ **Proceed to implementation**

**Rationale**:
- Plan is comprehensive (went from 200 lines → 550 lines)
- All critical concerns addressed
- Evaluator now asking for code-level details
- Diminishing returns on further planning
- Manual coordinator review: APPROVED

**Next step**: Assign to feature-developer agent for implementation
