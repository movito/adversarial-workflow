# Phase 6A.4: User Journey Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Task**: Map complete first-time user experience to identify pain points
**Methodology**: Trace user path from discovery through troubleshooting

---

## Executive Summary

**Analyzed Stages**: 4 main stages (Discovery → Installation → First Usage → Troubleshooting)
**Pain Points Found**: 12 significant issues across all stages
**Severity**: 4 CRITICAL, 5 MEDIUM, 3 LOW

**Key Insight**: Users experience confusion at EVERY stage due to:
1. Terminology inconsistency (Coordinator/Evaluator vs. Author/Reviewer)
2. Platform requirements not prominent enough
3. API key setup complexity
4. Unclear error messages

---

## Stage 1: Discovery

**Entry Points**: User finds package via PyPI, GitHub, search, or recommendation

### 1.1 GitHub / PyPI Page

**What User Sees**:
- Package name: `adversarial-workflow`
- Subtitle: "Multi-stage AI code review system preventing phantom work"
- Short description from README

**Current Experience**:
- ✅ Clear value proposition ("preventing phantom work")
- ✅ "100% Standalone" claim visible
- ⚠️ Platform requirements not immediately visible
- ❌ May still see deprecated terminology in description

**Pain Points**:
1. **MEDIUM**: Platform requirements not in short description
2. **LOW**: "Coordinator-Evaluator" in `__init__.py` docstring shows in package info

**Questions Users Have**:
- "Does this work on my OS?" (Not answered upfront)
- "What tools do I need?" (Not immediately clear)
- "Is this for me or for teams?" (Unclear)

---

### 1.2 README.md First Impression

**What User Reads** (lines 1-20):
```
# Adversarial Workflow

**Multi-stage AI code review system preventing phantom work**

Prevent "phantom work"... A battle-tested workflow...

**🎯 100% Standalone** - No special IDE or agent system required.

## Features
- 🔍 Multi-stage verification
- 🤖 Adversarial review
- 💰 Token-efficient
- 🔌 Non-destructive
- ⚙️ Configurable
- 🎯 Tool-agnostic
```

**Current Experience**:
- ✅ EXCELLENT: "100% Standalone" is prominent
- ✅ GOOD: Features list is clear
- ❌ NO platform requirements mentioned
- ❌ No API key requirements mentioned
- ⚠️ "Tool-agnostic" might confuse (what tools ARE needed?)

**Pain Points**:
3. **CRITICAL**: Platform requirements absent (Windows users proceed unaware)
4. **MEDIUM**: Required tools not listed (aider, API keys)
5. **LOW**: "Tool-agnostic" unclear (means implementation method, not infrastructure)

**Decision Point**: User decides "yes, I'll try this" without knowing:
- If it works on their OS
- What API keys they need
- How much it costs

---

## Stage 2: Installation & Setup

**User commits to trying the package. Now following Quick Start.**

### 2.1 Installation Command

**What User Does**:
```bash
pip install adversarial-workflow
```

**Current Experience**:
- ✅ Installation succeeds on all platforms (Python is cross-platform)
- ❌ **FALSE POSITIVE**: Native Windows users think it's working
- ❌ No platform check during pip install (can't add one)

**Pain Point**:
6. **CRITICAL**: Windows users successfully install, unaware it won't work

**User State**: Confident, thinks everything is working.

---

### 2.2 Interactive Setup (adversarial quickstart)

**What User Runs**:
```bash
adversarial quickstart
```

**Current Experience (Native Windows PowerShell)**:
```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  Adversarial Workflow Setup                            ║
║  Interactive Configuration Wizard                      ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

This wizard will help you:
  1. Choose your API setup
  2. Set up API keys
  3. Configure your project
  4. Create all necessary files

Ready to begin? (Y/n):
```

**Pain Points**:
7. **CRITICAL**: NO WARNING for Windows users (setup appears to work)
8. **MEDIUM**: API key step is complex (which provider? why two?)
9. **MEDIUM**: Terminology confusion ("Evaluator model" in prompts)

**What Happens Next**:
- User chooses API setup (confused by "implementation vs. evaluation")
- User pastes API keys (unsure if format is correct)
- User configures project (confused by evaluator_model config key)
- Setup SUCCEEDS with no warnings
- ❌ **User doesn't know setup is incomplete/incompatible**

**User State**: Thinks setup is complete, excited to try first task.

---

### 2.3 Creating First Task

**What User Does** (following quickstart):
```bash
# Wizard creates: tasks/example-bug-fix.md
```

**Current Experience**:
- ✅ Example task is created
- ✅ Clear bug fix example with implementation plan
- ⚠️ Example uses terms "Evaluator" in instructions
- ⚠️ Not clear what "evaluate" means in workflow context

**Pain Point**:
10. **LOW**: Example task mentions "Evaluator" (old terminology)

**User State**: Has a task, ready to try the workflow.

---

## Stage 3: First Usage

**User attempts to run the workflow for the first time.**

### 3.1 Plan Evaluation (Phase 1)

**What User Runs**:
```bash
adversarial evaluate tasks/example-bug-fix.md
```

**Expected Behavior**: Aider analyzes plan and provides feedback

**Current Experience (Native Windows)**:
```bash
C:\project> adversarial evaluate tasks\example-bug-fix.md

Error: Failed to execute evaluation script
'bash' is not recognized as an internal or external command
```

**Pain Point**:
11. **CRITICAL**: 🔴 **FAILURE** - Bash not found on native Windows
    - Generic error message (not helpful)
    - No mention of platform requirements
    - No suggestion to use WSL
    - User wasted 15-30 minutes on setup that can't work

**Current Experience (macOS/Linux/WSL)**:
```bash
$ adversarial evaluate tasks/example-bug-fix.md

╔════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║   PHASE 1: PLAN EVALUATION                 ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Task File: tasks/example-bug-fix.md
Model: gpt-4o

=== EVALUATOR (gpt-4o) REVIEWING PLAN ===

[Aider runs, provides feedback]

## Evaluation Summary
Verdict: APPROVED
Confidence: HIGH

[detailed feedback...]

Plan evaluation complete
```

**Pain Points (Successful Run)**:
12. **MEDIUM**: "EVALUATOR (gpt-4o)" in output (old terminology)
13. **LOW**: "Questions for Coordinator" in output (old terminology)

**User State (Success Path)**:
- Impressed by detailed feedback
- Ready to implement
- Might be confused by "Evaluator" and "Coordinator" terms

**User State (Failure Path - Native Windows)**:
- Frustrated
- Confused why it doesn't work
- May give up or search for solutions
- Might not find Platform Support section (buried at line 210)

---

### 3.2 Implementation (Phase 2)

**What User Does**:
User implements according to plan using their preferred method (any tool).

**Current Experience**:
- ✅ Clear: User can use any method
- ✅ Not prescriptive about tools
- ⚠️ Docs sometimes reference "Coordinator implements" (confusing)

**Pain Point**:
14. **MEDIUM**: Documentation inconsistently describes who implements
    - Sometimes: "Coordinator implements"
    - Sometimes: "You implement"
    - Unclear if "Coordinator" is them or a tool

**User State**: May be uncertain if they're doing it "right"

---

### 3.3 Code Review (Phase 3)

**What User Runs**:
```bash
git add -A
adversarial review
```

**Current Experience (Successful)**:
```bash
╔════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║   PHASE 3: IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW           ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════╝

=== EVALUATOR (gpt-4o) REVIEWING IMPLEMENTATION ===

[Aider reviews git diff]

## Review Summary
Verdict: APPROVED
Phantom Work Risk: NONE
Test Coverage: ADEQUATE

[detailed review...]
```

**Pain Points**:
15. **MEDIUM**: "EVALUATOR" in output (should be "REVIEWER")
16. **LOW**: "feature-developer" mentioned in some prompts (confusing)

**User State**: Gaining confidence in the workflow, but terminology is inconsistent.

---

### 3.4 Test Validation (Phase 4)

**What User Runs**:
```bash
adversarial validate "pytest tests/"
```

**Current Experience**:
```bash
╔════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║   PHASE 4: TEST VALIDATION                 ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════╝

=== TEST-RUNNER (gpt-4o) ANALYZING RESULTS ===

[Tests run, results analyzed]

## Validation Summary
Verdict: PASS
Test Status: ALL_PASS
Regressions Detected: NO
```

**Pain Points**:
17. **LOW**: "TEST-RUNNER" terminology (should be "REVIEWER" for consistency)

**User State**: Workflow complete! Feeling successful, but noticed terminology inconsistencies.

---

## Stage 4: Troubleshooting

**User encounters issues and searches for solutions.**

### 4.1 Common Error: "Evaluator always says NEEDS_REVISION"

**What User Searches**: docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md

**Current Experience**:
- ✅ Issue is documented (line 488)
- ❌ Title uses old terminology ("Evaluator")
- ⚠️ Solution explains, but doesn't clarify terminology

**Pain Point**:
18. **MEDIUM**: Troubleshooting docs use old terminology
    - User searches for "Evaluator" (works)
    - Should search for "Reviewer" (new terminology)
    - Mixed terminology across troubleshooting guide

---

### 4.2 Platform-Specific Issues

**What Windows User Discovers** (after bash error):
- Searches README for "Windows"
- Finds Platform Support section (line 210)
- Discovers they needed WSL all along
- **Frustrated** - wasted 30+ minutes on incompatible setup

**Pain Point**:
19. **CRITICAL**: Platform requirements discovered TOO LATE
    - User already invested time in setup
    - Had to debug confusing bash error
    - Platform Support section buried (not prominent)

**User State**: Frustrated, might abandon package.

---

### 4.3 API Key Issues

**Common Issues**:
- API key format incorrect
- API key not set in environment
- Wrong model specified

**Current Experience**:
- ⚠️ Error messages exist but not always helpful
- ⚠️ Setup wizard validates format, but could be better
- ⚠️ No clear troubleshooting for API key issues

**Pain Point**:
20. **MEDIUM**: API key errors need better guidance
    - Which key is missing? (Anthropic vs. OpenAI)
    - What's the correct format?
    - Where should keys be set?

---
